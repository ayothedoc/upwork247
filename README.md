Automated Mouse Movement and Keypress
This repository contains a Python script that uses the pyautogui library to automate mouse movement and keypresses. The script moves the mouse cursor to the top left corner of the screen and then moves it down in increments of 5 pixels, pressing the shift key three times after each movement.
